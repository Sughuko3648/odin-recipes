        <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Step 1: <b>Prepare the beans</b></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Use beans that are already peeled. If not, soak beans for a few minutes and peel off the skin (rub between your palms in water, rinse, and discard the skins).</li>
                <li>Boil peeled beans in a pot with water until very soft (about 40–60 minutes).</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <hr>

        <div>
            <h3>Step 2: <b>Blend</b></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Once beans are soft, blend them smoothly with some of the cooking water (or use a wooden spoon to mash if you prefer).</li>
                <li>Blend together the onion, pepper(s), and tomatoes (if using)</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Step 3: <b>Cook the Soup</b></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Return the blended beans to the pot.</li>
                <li>Add palm oil, blended pepper mix, ground crayfish (if using), and seasoning cubes.</li>
                <li>Stir well and allow to cook on medium heat for about 10–15 minutes, until the soup thickens slightly.</li>
                <li>Add salt to taste.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <h3>Step 4: <b>Serve</b></h3>

                <li>Gbegiri is often served with ewedu soup and stew alongside amala (yam flour swallow).</li>
                <li>It can also be eaten with rice or other swallows like semo, fufu, or pounded yam.</li>
